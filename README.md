Overview
This repository contains Python implementations of fundamental machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms built from scratch (without relying on high-level ML libraries like scikit-learn or TensorFlow). The purpose is to provide a deep understanding of how these algorithms work under the hood.

Features
Pure Python implementations (NumPy allowed for numerical operations)

Well-documented code with mathematical explanations

Educational focus - designed for learning rather than production use

Jupyter notebook examples for each algorithm

Test cases to verify implementations
